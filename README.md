# Miniprojects

## 1. Project Description
The project is part of the course ITMO544 Cloud Computing Technologies (Illinois Institute of Technology)

This project is composed by different miniprojects that aims to practice with different AWS services and scripting.

This project defines a web application that allows an user to upload an image and received a customized one.
Each miniproject creates a tier 4 cloud environment formed by an Application Load Balancer, frontend and backend instances, database and storage system, queue system and a notification system.

The frontend instances provide a web application that allow users to upload an image via a load balancer. The image is stored in a storage system and processed by a backend instance. A customized image (or the URL to download it) is returned to the user.

I hereby recommend for future students of this course not to copy from this project. I have added some features and this kind of project is easy to change or add new services.

Each project has a more detailed description in its own folder
