# Miniprojects

## 1. Project Description
The project is part of the course ITMO544 Cloud Computing Technologies (Illinois Institute of Technology)

This folder is composed by different miniprojects (3 miniprojects) developed to practice with AWS services. A project with a higer number name value is in lower number name projects, i.e mp2 is based on mp1.

The aim of these miniprojects is to create a Web Application that allows an user to upload an image. Once the image is uploaded to the server, some image processing is done backwards.

I hereby recommend for future students of this course not to copy from this project. I have added some features and this kind of project is easy to change or add new services.

## 2. AWS Services
EC2
S3
SNS
SQS
RDS

There should be at least 3 miniprojects but mi intention is to add more features.
